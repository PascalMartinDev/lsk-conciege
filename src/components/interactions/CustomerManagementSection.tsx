/**
 * DOCUMENTATION: CustomerManagementSection Component
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * A React coordinator component that manages the display of customer interaction
 * interfaces based on workflow state. Serves as the central router between
 * customer creation forms and customer search functionality.
 * 
 * FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Conditionally renders customer form or search interfaces
 * - Provides seamless transitions between different management modes
 * - Integrates with workflow context for state-driven UI switching
 * - Supports both customer creation and lookup operations
 * 
 * COMPONENT ROUTING:
 * Two primary interaction modes:
 * 1. Customer Form Mode (showCreateForm = true)
 *    - Displays AddUpdateCustomerForm for creating/editing customers
 * 2. Customer Search Mode (showSearchBox = true)  
 *    - Displays LookupCustomerSearch for finding existing customers
 * 
 * STATE MANAGEMENT:
 * Uses useWorkflow hook to access:
 * - showCreateForm: Boolean controlling form display
 * - showSearchBox: Boolean controlling search interface display
 * - States can be independent - both can be false (showing customer details)
 * 
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * Essential for wine retail customer management workflow:
 * - New customer registration for wine club membership
 * - Existing customer profile updates and edits
 * - Customer lookup during POS transactions
 * - Member verification for discount application
 * - Contact information updates and maintenance
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - useWorkflow hook: Primary state management connection
 * - AddUpdateCustomerForm: Customer data entry and modification
 * - LookupCustomerSearch: Customer search and selection interface
 * - MainSection: Parent component rendering logic
 * 
 * WORKFLOW TRANSITIONS:
 * Component handles these user flows:
 * 1. Default → Search Mode (customer lookup)
 * 2. Default → Form Mode (new customer creation)
 * 3. Search Results → Form Mode (edit selected customer)
 * 4. Form Mode → Default (after save/cancel)
 * 5. Search Mode → Default (after selection)
 * 
 * COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Pure routing component with no local state
 * - Conditional rendering based on external state
 * - Clean separation between search and form responsibilities
 * - Lightweight coordinator pattern implementation
 * 
 * UI/UX FLOW:
 * - Smooth transitions between management interfaces
 * - State-driven rendering prevents UI conflicts
 * - Each child component handles its own interaction patterns
 * - Consistent layout and styling across modes
 * 
 * RENDERING LOGIC:
 * - Fragment wrapper for clean DOM structure
 * - Conditional rendering with boolean state checks
 * - No overlapping interface states (exclusive modes)
 * - Graceful handling of state transitions
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Minimal component overhead (no local state)
 * - Child components manage their own re-rendering
 * - State changes trigger efficient conditional re-renders
 * - No unnecessary component mounting/unmounting
 * 
 * The component serves as a clean abstraction layer between the main
 * application flow and specific customer management operations.
